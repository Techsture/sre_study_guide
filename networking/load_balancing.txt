- Distributes workloads across multiple computing resources.
- Algorithm examples:
  - Random
  - Round Robin
    - Just goes around in a loop
  - Weighted Round Robin
    - Same as round robin, except some servers get a larger share of the overall traffic.
  - Source IP
    - Connections are distributed to the backend servers based on a hash of the source IP address.
    - As long as all servers are running, a give client IP address will always go to the same web server.
  - URL
    - Connections are distributed to the backend servers based on a hash of the URL request.
    - Useful when balancing in front of caches since requests for a given object will always go to just one backend cache, avoiding cache duplication.
  - Least Connections
    - Load balancer monitors the number of open connections for each server and sends to the least busy of them.
  - Least Traffic
    - Load balancer monitors the bitrate from each server and sends to the one with the least amount of outgoing traffic.
  - Least Latency
    - A simple request is made to each server and the load is sent to the first responder.
