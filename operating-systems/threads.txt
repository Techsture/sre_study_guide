- The kernel sees no distiction between process and threads; everything is simply a runnable task.
  - Each process has a separate stack, text, data, and heap.
  - Threads have their own stack, but share text, data, and heap with the process.
- Threads are called "Light Weight Processes" (LWP) at kernel level, and threads at user level.
- When a thread is created, it's assigned a Thread ID.
  - Unlike a PID (which is unique across the system), a thread ID is unique only in the context of a single process.
  - Thread IDs are not necessarily integers; they could be structures.
  - Not easy to print, like a PID.
- Two interfaces to create threads:
  - clone()
    - Low level system call.
  - pthread_create()
    - Higher level interface.
- Linux threading is 1:1 (not 1:N or M:N).
