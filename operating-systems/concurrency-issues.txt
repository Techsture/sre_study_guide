- Race Conditions
  - Happens when multiple instances interleave processes instead of running them in the as-expected sequence.
  - Critical Region:
    - Piece of code containing the concurrency issue.
  - Solution:
    - Recognize when simultaneous accesses occur.
    - Use locks to make sure only one instance can enter the critical region at any time.
