# Stacks (Data Structures)

- - An ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end (LIFO).
  - Items come off the stacked in the reversed order of how they were put on ((1, 2, 3) => (3, 2, 1)) such as the "Back" button on a web browser.
