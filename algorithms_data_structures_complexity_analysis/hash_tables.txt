# Hash Tables (Data Structures)

- A collection of items which are stored in such a way as to make them easier to find later.

- The goal is to create a hash function that minimizes the number of collisions, is easy to compute, and evenly distributes the items in the hash table.

- Collisions can be resolved in a few ways, such as:
  - Chaining
    - Allow many items to exist at the same location, but add a linked list to each slot of the hash table that holds all the numbers for that slot.
  - Linear Probing
    - If the hash slot has an item in it, increment the position by a fixed amount until you find an empty slot.
    - To find it again, find the slot it should be in.  If it doesn't exist there, change the position of the pointer until you locate the number.
